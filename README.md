# Task Processing Queue

## Scope

This project is designed to handle task processing using a queue system. It ensures tasks are processed efficiently and in order, providing a scalable solution for managing background jobs.

## Architecture

The architecture of the project is based on a producer-consumer model:

- **Producer**: Adds tasks to the queue.
- **Queue**: Stores tasks until they are processed.
- **Consumer**: Processes tasks from the queue.

The system is designed to be scalable, allowing multiple producers and consumers to work concurrently.
